Subject: [PATCH 21/37] create-diff-object: create dynamic relocs for changed
 functions in this object

Currently, we only create dynamic relocs for changed functions of
other objects, but not this object. It will cause a problem like:

original:       funcA and funcB         (funcA calls funcB)
patch-1:        funcA-1 and funcB-1     (funcA-1 calls funcB-1)
patch-2:        funcB-2         (funcA-1 should call funcB-2)

But as we don't create dynamic relocs for funcA-1, it will call
funcB-1 directly (not by jumping from funcB). So the new funcB-2
will not get called. This patch will create dynamic relocs for
all the changed functions, including changed ones in this object.
