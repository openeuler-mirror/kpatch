Subject: [PATCH 6/9] create-diff-object: ignore changed of section
 __patchable_function_entries

Linux 5.10 aarch64 uses -fpatchable-function-entry=N to generate N NOPs at the
beginning of each function, Section __patchable_function_entries is generated
to record the starting address of these NOPs.

Section __patchable_function_entries will change if the number of functions
changed during making hotpatch, here we just ignore the change of this section.
